# rockpaperscissor

// Step Two 
/*
Create function getComputerChoice - will randomly choose one of three options
Create three variables holding rock, scissor, paper
Create algo that have a 33.3% chance for each variable to be returned
- 0-0.33 Rock
- 0.34 - 066 Paper
- 0.67 - 0.99 Scissor
Use if else to define the return

*/

/*Step 3
Write fn getHumanChoice where user can choose btw rock, paper, scissor
add a prompt where user writes choice - if no valid input, ask again
add variables to hold the choice
(add a multi choice to avoid any wrong doing?)
*/

//getHumanChoice();

/*
Step 4
create two variables to hold pc and human scores
they should both start at 0
*/

/*
Step 5
create a function playRound to play a round of the game
define two params to take in the choices of pc and user 
make the input choice case insensitive - use lowercase method
use logic to understand who wins in each round - rock beats scissor
scissor beats paper
paper beats rock
if logic where each one gives a point to the score 
and writes out the winner in the log
*/

/*
Step 6
create a fn playGame to play 5 rounds
playround should be inside this function and be repeated 5 times, with loop?
need to get new choices from the computer each time
return random value and then chose the best fit in this fn?
